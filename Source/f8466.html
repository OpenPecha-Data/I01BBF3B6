	<h2>A Brief Presentation of View, MeditationÂ and Action</h2>
<p><strong><em>by Yangthang Rinpoche</em></strong></p>
<h3>Homage</h3>
<p>Primordial protector, who remains forever within the single all-encompassing sphere of reality,<br/>
Lord who pervades all buddha families, Lama Vajradhara,<br/>
With complete reliance and fervent devotion, I pray to you one-pointedly:<br/>
Grant your blessings so that the wisdom-mind transmission may enter my heart!</p>
<h3>Preliminaries</h3>
<p>Now that you've gained the support of a human life, so hard to find,<br/>
Aroused a mind of renunciation, so difficult to develop,<br/>
Met an authentic master, so rarely encountered,<br/>
And taken up the sacred Dharma, so scarcely discovered,<br/>
Reflect, overÂ and again, on the difficulty of finding<br/>
Such a physical support providing all the right conditions for practice.<br/>
If you fail to make use of the full human potential you now possess,<br/>
Which is impermanent like a candle in the wind,<br/>
Don't think that you can rely on it for a long time to come.<br/>
At deathÂ and in the bardos, lacking the confidence of liberation,<br/>
How frightening will be the next lifeâs sufferings!<br/>
When we must wander endlessly in saá¹sÄra,<br/>
How distressing it is to contemplate its nature!<br/>
Whatever you can do to gain real confidence in this life,<br/>
I, for one, will be most grateful!<br/>
This is what I hope for you. </p>
<h3>View</h3>
<p>If you wish to look into the mirror of mind's nature,<br/>
Don't look outwards, but turn within.<br/>
Looking outwards brings perpetual delusion.<br/>
But look withinÂ and you'll see your own mind.<br/>
Don't follow past thoughts,<br/>
Nor anticipate thoughts to come,<br/>
And as for present thoughtsÂ and agitation,<br/>
As soon as you turn your mind inwards,<br/>
Don't try to adjust or modify it in the slightest,<br/>
But leave it, just as it is, totally free, in its own natural resting place.<br/>
Leaving thoughts in their natural place of rest like this<br/>
Is not the actual main practice, but simply the way to leave the mind.<br/>
Yet in that very experience of leaving the mind in this way<br/>
You're on the verge of meeting the rigpa of the main practice.<br/>
As soon as you leave the mind in its natural state,<br/>
Thoughts will naturally ceaseÂ and be gone.<br/>
What is left when the natural radiance of thoughts has vanished,<br/>
Is the essence of mind, emptyÂ and vivid.<br/>
Free of fixation, dimension or limit,<br/>
There arises a space-like experience.<br/>
This is the empty essence, the <em>dharmakÄya</em>.<br/>
In this empty state,<br/>
The nature of the mind is clearÂ and lucid â<br/>
Free of any actual characteristic one could point to,<br/>
It is the natural clarity of the mind, unrestrainedÂ and unimpeded.<br/>
Innately cognizant, it's the <em>saá¹bhogakÄya</em>.<br/>
Besides this cognizant yet empty rigpa,<br/>
There is no other one that sees.<br/>
What is seen is the empty <em>dharmakÄya</em>,<br/>
And the one that sees it is cognizant wisdom,<br/>
These two can be referred to as âemptyâÂ and âcognizantâ,<br/>
Or as âall-pervading spaceâÂ and âwisdom.â<br/>
But they're not two different things:<br/>
The nature of that which is empty is clarity,<br/>
And the essence of that which is clear is empty.<br/>
Therefore, clarityÂ and emptiness are an inseparable unity.<br/>
Since they're not different, but of a single taste,<br/>
There's no duality of something seenÂ and one who sees it,<br/>
This is âseeingâ in a non-dual way.<br/>
Hence it is called âself-knowing rigpa.â<br/>
The mind sees itself by itself.<br/>
In the experience of the single taste of clarityÂ and emptiness,<br/>
GoodÂ and bad â saá¹sÄraÂ and nirvÄá¹a âÂ are of equal taste.<br/>
Thus, âsaá¹sÄraÂ and nirvÄá¹aâ are not different.<br/>
This is the Great Perfection, <em>Dzogpachenpo</em>.<br/>
This Great Perfection,<br/>
When it is realized by anyone at all,<br/>
Brings impartial compassion<br/>
And unlimited pure perception â<br/>
Arising effortlesslyÂ and naturally in the mind.<br/>
This is all-pervading compassion, the nirmÄá¹akÄya.<br/>
This, therefore, is the three-kÄya rigpa.<br/>
Decide that there is nothing else apart from this.<br/>
As long as you're undecided, youâll be scattered<br/>
And never realize the nature of mind.<br/>
Decision must be made in certainty.<br/>
This is the view of the Great Perfection. </p>
<h3>Meditation</h3>
<p>Of the view, meditationÂ and action, view is most important.<br/>
It's crucial that you realize the view without error,<br/>
For unless you realize the view, meditation will have no basis.<br/>
So you must realize the view directly, with no confusion.<br/>
And then, when taking this to heart through meditation,<br/>
To abide in the experience of the view that you have recognized,<br/>
For longer and longer periods, through perseverance, is meditation.<br/>
Other than this, there's nothing else on which to meditate.<br/>
Furthermore, until you perfect the view,<br/>
Don't count your practice in years or months,<br/>
But decide to dedicate the whole remainder of your life to Dharma practice.<br/>
This is the approach of the very best practitioners.<br/>
If from the start you talk about simplicity, equalityÂ and the like,<br/>
But instead of practicing in sessions remain completely lax,<br/>
Acting out whatever comes to mind, whether eating, sitting, indulging yourself or lying about,<br/>
In the end, there's a great danger your simplicity will prove futile,<br/>
And when death comes, all will have been in vain.<br/>
Meaningless talkÂ and boasting are useless,<br/>
So you should follow in the footsteps of the great ones,<br/>
And be humble, a genuine Dharma practitioner in wordÂ and deed.<br/>
It would be best to go to deserted mountains,<br/>
But, otherwise, stay away from busy places.<br/>
Having divided your time into sessionsÂ and periods in-between.<br/>
Practise meditation formally, and abandon the nine forms of activity.<br/>
Without being outwardly distracted or inwardly grasping,<br/>
Settle evenly into an experience of the natural resting place of mind.<br/>
No matter what appears to the five senses,<br/>
Let it be like stars or planets reflected in the surface of a lake,<br/>
And rest evenly in the natural expanse, without grasping<br/>
And without the slightest reference point â <em>this</em> is the supreme meditation.<br/>
Although this may be difficult in the beginning,<br/>
With gradual training, it will progressively unfold.<br/>
In post-meditation, train in emptinessÂ and compassion,<br/>
Seeing things as magical illusions or dreamlike.<br/>
Exert yourself as much as you can in the Dharma practices that purify obscurations.<br/>
And, in particular, it's crucial to merge the view from the time of meditation<br/>
With whatever thoughts arise, in order to unite meditationÂ and post-meditation.<br/>
Distinguish between the all-groundÂ and <em>dharmakÄya</em>, mindÂ and rigpa.<br/>
Recognize qualitiesÂ and faults such as the three forms of erring, strayingÂ and being mistaken,<br/>
And make adopting qualitiesÂ and avoiding faults the very heart of your practice.<br/>
This is what to do during the post-meditation.<br/>
When you strive in such practice for a long time,<br/>
All the experiences of bliss, clarityÂ and emptiness will occur.<br/>
But no matter what arises, don't fixate on the constant flow of perceptions,<br/>
But resolve them with the view,Â and maintain the flow of practice in the natural resting place of mind.<br/>
Progressively, positive experiences will increase,Â and bad signs disappear.<br/>
In each session, first arouse the mind of enlightenment,<br/>
And receive the four empowerments of guru yoga.<br/>
At the end, seal the session with dedicationÂ and aspiration prayers.<br/>
Since these provide the structure of meditation practice, they're indispensable.<br/>
In particular, the practice of Guru Yoga<br/>
Is the ultimate means of arriving at the state of non-meditation.<br/>
So, until your own rigpa dawns directly as the lama,<br/>
Since this is the main form of meditation practice, cherish it as crucial!<br/>
If you can practise like this in four sessions each and every day,<br/>
Constantly and without wavering,<br/>
Youâll perfect the various stages, such as the five experiences Vimalamitra taught,<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a><br/>
And in the original resting place,<br/>
Youâll seize the citadel â of this you must have no doubt!<br/>
Even if you can't manage this,Â and you practise these instructions with only moderate effort,<br/>
ListeningÂ to and reflecting upon the teachings to a certain extent,<br/>
Attachment to the eight worldly concerns will weaken,<br/>
And youâll spend your life carefree, contentedÂ and at ease.<br/>
From your very first step on the path it won't take long<br/>
Before you're liberated in primordial omniscience â this is certain! </p>
<h3>Action</h3>
<p>Then, to touch briefly upon action:<br/>
When you're resting in meditation in this way<br/>
And a new thought arises all of a sudden<br/>
Or the undercurrent of thoughts churns away,<br/>
Rising thoughts are seen from the experience of your own rigpa.<br/>
Don't follow them, considering them good or bad, pleasant or suffering.<br/>
Don't do anything, in fact. But, as soon as you see the rising,<br/>
Within the rising itself, let mind find its own natural place of rest.<br/>
By leaving mind in its own place, thoughts will disappear there and then,<br/>
And you'll arrive directly at rigpa once again.<br/>
Then, as before, maintain the practice of mindâs own place of rest.<br/>
In this way, whenever any good or bad thought should arise<br/>
Don't grasp onto it, but allow it to be freed as it arises.<br/>
There are three ways in which thoughts are liberated,<br/>
But there's really no difference between them â they're all 'self-arising,Â self-liberation'.<br/>
When a thought appears, it comes from the expanse of <em>dharmakÄya</em>,<br/>
And when a thought goes, it ceases within rigpa's expanse.<br/>
Risings are harmless if you know how to let them liberate naturally.<br/>
This is the special instruction to enhance the view.<br/>
If you exert yourself in this, youâll have fewer thoughts,<br/>
And their arising will not harm the ground.<br/>
The three ways of liberating â lesser, middlingÂ and greater â will unfold progressively.<br/>
But without these key points of liberation,<br/>
The final attainment of freedom will never come.<br/>
Knowing the way to liberate thoughts is the supreme form of action.<br/>
The fruition of such practice is that<br/>
Destructive emotionsÂ and thoughts will weaken,<br/>
Attachment to the eight worldly concerns will diminish,<br/>
DevotionÂ and pure perception will steadily increase,<br/>
Youâll recognize dreams, clear light will arise,Â and so on â<br/>
These are authentic fruits of the path.<br/>
Otherwise, to have visions of deities, receive prophecies,<br/>
Gain clairvoyanceÂ and the like may or may not be the fruit of the path,<br/>
Whether good or bad, we can't say, for it could all be the deception of MÄra,<br/>
So don't wait, but immediately put them aside.<br/>
Finally, at death or in the bardo of <em>dharmatÄ</em>,<br/>
Recognize the ground appearances,Â and, in that very ground,<br/>
Having seized the citadel, you're certain to gain liberation! </p>
<p>I have written this brief presentation of View, MeditationÂ and Action,<br/>
Merely as a response to a friendâs request which I couldn't refuse â<br/>
A rather hypocritical endeavor for one who knows nothing of what is here described,<br/>
And one which will undoubtedly produce many errors.<br/>
Be sure, therefore, to ask others to clarify your every doubt.<br/>
In the unlikely event that this does contain one or two points of value,<br/>
I dedicate the merit so they may be a cause for my friendâs practice to grow in strength,<br/>
And for it to be accomplished completely,<br/>
So that he may be liberated in the expanse of the primordial ground.<br/>
In short, I pray for the accomplishment of the twofold benefit. </p>
<p><em>I, the one who bears the name of Yangthang Tulku, wrote this rather incoherent, disorganized text simply to avoid turning down the insistent request of Lama Tsewang, a Dharma friend from Riwoche in Kham. May it be a cause of benefitting a friend's practice!</em></p>
